# Natural-Language-Processing
 In this project, I built a foundation for Natural Language Processing in Python. I covered tokenizing, stemming, part of speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and text classification. 

In future projects , will look at combining mutliple classification algorithms to produce better results. Furthermore will move on to more difficult challenges, such as sentiment analysis.
